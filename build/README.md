Interface is simple and self-explanatory.

Syntax rules:
Multiplication must always be shown using the dot (â€¢) operator. If you do not use the dot operator, your function will not multiply the terms specified.

Space operator:
The ___ or space operator works just like a space between terms if you feel like you are lazy to use parentheses.
For example x^2 +2 (space between ^2 and +) will sandbox the term x^2 without using parentheses.

dx operator:
Derivative with respect to x.

dy operator:
Derivative with respect to y.

F(x) operator:
Integration of x-terms.

F(y) operator:
Integration of y-terms.

f(x,y) operator:
Regular operation of the z function.

Color palettes:
Magenta, Purple, Yellow, and Orange.

Plot operation:
Normally, functions with asymptotes or that end abruptly at the ends of the window will connect the ends of the line together to form one concurrent line. If you see these strange apparitions while graphing in CONTOUR mode, PLOT mode is more suitable as it describes graphical behavior normally.

Contour operation:
Graphs the functions as a set of lines, they graph more accurately but prone to error when graphing asymptotes (1/x) or graphing functions that are non-linear and odd (x^3). If these errors appear, you should graph in PLOT mode.

Graph button:
Graphs the function with your options.
May take a while depending on viewfinder dimensions and graphing options as well as graphical complexity.

Viewfinder Dimensions:
Total length of window in the specified direction.
Example: Input X as 100, graphs from -50 to 50.

Evaluation Context:
If you do not wish to graph but to grab the value of a function at a point (such as when using derivatives), you can input X or Y values and return an alert with the number.
